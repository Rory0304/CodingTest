### Original

```python
def solution(numbers):
    originalNumberList = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9];

    originalNumberListSum = sum(originalNumberList);
    numberSum = sum(numbers);

    return originalNumberListSum - numberSum
```


### lambda

```python
solution = lambda numbers: sum(range(10)) - sum(numbers)
```
